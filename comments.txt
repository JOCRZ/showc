@shortsindia8378: This novel making me insane
@One_more_try-o9r: Disclaimer for the first time ? , goddamn I got frightenedTo realise that thise popular sayings were from this chapter. It's truly special
@depot-lb8hl: This version is really good! Probably the best out of the free RI readings I've tried.The voice isn't perfect but better than others especially with some Chinese character names that they often struggle with.One annoying thing is the translator is mentioned at each of the 1000 chapter beginnings.I like that the image is static. It changes depending on which arc it is I think.If you have tech skills or patience with chatGPT, it's really cool to use python to collect some audio data. And in that case I don't think the chapter division is bad.
@ToshiroHitsugaya328: Loving the novel so far am at chapter 148 so far, and came back to chapter one to say its a great listen!

@One_more_try-o9r: There is really depth in the meaning of these tales. Ig this is the wisdom shared.
@blade4048: People always say you can't control who you love, and it really sucks when it's not returned. You might do crazy things, even put yourself in danger, trying to get someone to love you back, but it doesn't always work. Love can take over your whole life, too, and mess with what you want to do. So, if you're trying to get somewhere, love could really get in the way.Also due this incidence rockman race is obsessed with love.
